# Webscrape_pdf

The R Code


Ideally, the R code will pull three KPIs from one PDF and summarize into a table. This process will iterate to extract the three KPIs from a list of daily PDF files. 
Input: A csv or excel file with the list of dates. This will update the tail-end of the hyperlink to initiate PDF extraction.
Output: A table with columns of dates and the three specific KPIs populated.
